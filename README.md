TileMap Example
================
 OpenFL 4 added TileMap and this project is an example for using TileMap.
 
 TileMap is a way to add graphics to the UI from a Sprite-map or a single sheet of graphics.

 - [Reference tutorial is here][1]
 - [Project XML format][2]

 TileMaps can not use `eventHandler`, so we have to put it inside a `event` dispatching Object, such as `Sprite`.
